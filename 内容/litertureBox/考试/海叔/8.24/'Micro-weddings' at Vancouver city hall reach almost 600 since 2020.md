 - 在谢烨⽗⺟和姐姐的⻅证下，这对新⼈在婚 姻专员黛安-布朗（Diane Brown）⾯前交换了 誓⾔，仪式⾮常简单，在规定的半⼩时内就结 束了。 7.Some applause, some photographs — including one in Mayor Ken Sim’s chair — and a quick ring of the chamber’s ship bell, and they were done. 8.“We’re reasonably new to Canada and the city, so we picked an iconic venue, which is quite a nice place to get married,” said Watson, standing in the lobby with his bride after the ceremony. 7.⼀些掌声，⼀些合影--包括在市⻓肯-⾟ （Ken Sim）的椅⼦上的合影--然后快速敲响 会议厅的船钟，他们就完成了。 8.沃森说："我们对加拿⼤和这座城市还算陌 ⽣，所以我们选择了⼀个标志性的场地，这是 ⼀个⾮常适合结婚的地⽅。" 9.England, Malaysia 10.Watson, a family physician, is originally from England. Cheah, a business analyst, is from Malaysia. The couple met in Australia before moving to Vancouver a year ago, and are now in the process of applying for permanent residency status. 9.英国，⻢来⻄亚 10.家庭医⽣沃森来⾃英国。商业分析师 Cheah 来⾃⻢来⻄亚。这对新⼈在澳⼤利亚 相识，⼀年前移居温哥华，⽬前正在申请永久 居留身份。 11.Cheah learned that getting married at city hall was an option after watching a video that a woman posted on YouTube. The couple is planning a big celebration in August in England, but wanted to get married in Vancouver. 12.“My family was visiting, too, so we thought this would be a good time,” she said. 11.Cheah是在观看了⼀位⼥⼠在YouTube上 发布的视频后，才知道在市政厅结婚也是⼀种 选择。这对新⼈计划 8 ⽉份在英国举⾏盛⼤ 的庆祝活动，但他们想在温哥华举⾏婚礼。 12. "我的家⼈也来了，所以我们觉得这是个好 时机，"她说。 
 - The magic of technology allowed Watson’s family in England and a friend of Cheah’s in Mexico to watch the ceremony via Zoom — at least that was the idea, until the couple learned later the feed from Watson’s cellphone malfunctioned halfway through the ceremony. 
 - Plenty of photographs were taken, though. 13.科技的魔⼒让 Watson 在英国的家⼈和 Cheah 在墨⻄哥的⼀位朋友通过 Zoom 观看 了婚礼--⾄少他们是这么想的，直到后来这对 新⼈得知 Watson 的⼿机在婚礼进⾏到⼀半时 出现了故障。 14.不过还是拍了很多照⽚。 15.Pandemic initiative 16.The husband and wife were the fourth of six couples to get married in the chamber April 5, adding to what has been a steady parade of people choosing to get hitched at city hall since “micro-weddings” were offered in May 2020. 15.⼤流⾏倡议 16.这对夫妇是4⽉5⽇在市政厅举⾏婚礼的六 对夫妇中的第四对，⾃2020年5⽉提供 "微型 婚礼 "以来，选择在市政厅举⾏婚礼的⼈越来 越多。 17.The program, which began as a trial, offered 30-minute wedding ceremonies between June 2020 and May 2021. 18.The initiative, which was pushed by former city councillor Melissa De Genova, filled what the city said was an immediate need for couples and marriage officiants wanting to continue with wedding plans during the pandemic. 17.该计划从2020年6⽉⾄2021年5⽉期间提供 30分钟的婚礼仪式。 18.由前市议员梅丽莎-德-吉诺瓦（Melissa De Genova）推动的这⼀举措，满⾜了市政府 所说的新⼈和婚姻司仪希望在⼤流⾏病期间继 续婚礼计划的迫切需求。 19.Positive feedback on the weddings and the demand from couples has since made it a permanent program, with the city offering a total of 590 time-slots for weddings since 2020; the city says the number includes late cancellations and rescheduling, which are very rare. 19.婚礼的积极反馈和新⼈的需求使该计划成 为⼀项永久性计划，⾃2020年以来，市政府 共提供了590个婚礼时段；市政府表示，这个 数字包括后期取消和重新安排的婚礼，但这种 情况⾮常罕⻅。

'Micro-weddings' at Vancouver city hall reach almost 600 since 2020 温哥华市政厅的“微型婚礼”⾃2020年以来达 到近600场 Source：https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/local news/micro-weddings-at-vancouver-city-hall-reach almost-600-since-2020-8588676 20.'Sparked a few tears' 21.Hrissa Soumpassis, protocol officer with the city’s external relations and protocol department, said the six time-slots offered per day on the designated wedding days always sell out. 20. “引发了⼏滴眼泪” 21.该市对外关系和礼宾部⻔的礼宾官赫⾥萨 苏姆帕⻄斯（Hrissa Soumpassis）说，指定 婚礼⽇每天提供的六个时段总是⼀售⽽空。 22.The slots sell out the fastest in spring and summer, said Soumpassis in an email exchange this week. She said each ceremony is unique and memorable, whether it’s the non-traditional outfits, music selection — everything from the Beatles to Bach — or personalized vows. 23.“Micro-weddings allow ease in wedding planning so couples can really relax and enjoy the moment for themselves,” said Soumpassis, who was present during the marriage of Watson and Cheah. 22.苏姆帕⻄斯在本周的⼀封电⼦邮件交流中 说，春季和夏季的时段卖得最快。她说，⽆论 是⾮传统的服装、⾳乐选择--从披头⼠到巴赫--还是个性化的誓⾔，每场仪式都是独⼀⽆ ⼆、令⼈难忘的。 23.苏姆帕⻄丝说："微型婚礼让婚礼策划变得 轻松，新⼈可以真正放松下来，享受属于⾃⼰ 的时刻。" 24.Staff are sometimes relied upon to assist brides. 25.“There were a few times where staff were asked to help the bride hide in the city hall building before the special moment,” she said. “Without fail, when the bride pops out, there are always tears, big smiles and that energy is really palpable — it’s even sparked a few tears within our own team.” 24.有时需要⼯作⼈员协助新娘。 25. "有⼏次，⼯作⼈员被要求在特殊时刻到来 之前帮助新娘躲进市政厅⼤楼，"她说。"她 说："每当新娘出现时，⼤家总是热泪盈眶， 笑容灿烂，那种能量真的是可想⽽知--这甚⾄ 让我们⾃⼰的团队也流下了眼泪。" 26.Hollywood movies 27.Staff has heard from couples that they assumed a city hall wedding would be the fastest, cheapest and easiest way to get married — an assumption driven by portrayals of weddings in Hollywood movies and television shows. 26.好莱坞电影 27.⼯作⼈员曾听新⼈说过，他们以为市政厅 婚礼是最快、最便宜、最简单的结婚⽅式--好 莱坞电影和电视节⽬中对婚礼的描述让他们产 ⽣了这种想法。 28.While it is a fast and simple way of getting hitched, Soumpassis said, couples need to fill out an application, choose a time-slot, hire a wedding commissioner or officiant, buy a marriage licence and bring two witnesses — “unlike American movies where city hall staff handle all paperwork for the couples.” 29.Couples can choose between ceremonies of up to 10 people on Mondays at $302.50 plus GST, or up to 20 people available on other days of the week at $605 plus GST. Additional guests can be included for an extra charge of $30.25 plus GST per person. 28.苏姆帕⻄斯说，虽然这是⼀种快速、简单 的结婚⽅式，但新⼈需要填写申请表、选择时 间段、聘请婚礼专员或司仪、购买结婚证并携 带两名证婚⼈--"这与美国电影中市政厅⼯作⼈ 员为新⼈处理所有⽂书⼯作不同"。 29.新⼈可以选择在周⼀举⾏多达 10 ⼈的仪 式，费⽤为 302.50 美元加商品及服务税，或 者在⼀周的其他⽇⼦举⾏多达 20 ⼈的仪式， 费⽤为 605 美元加商品及服务税。额外的宾 客也可以参加，每⼈额外收费 30.25 美元加消 费税。 30.Receptions are not permitted. 31.While weddings in the council chamber are only a few years old, couples had previously been married on the grounds of city hall, especially during the early days of the pandemic. 30.不允许举办招待会。 31.虽然在议会厅举⾏婚礼只有⼏年的历史， 但以前也有新⼈在市政厅的场地上举⾏婚礼， 特别是在⼤流⾏病早期。 32.Helena Gutteridge Plaza behind city hall served as the main venue. 33.Former councillor Tim Stevenson, a longtime United Church minister, told the Vancouver Courier in 2018 that he married a couple on the back steps of city hall as part of a ceremony to mark the anniversary of the Stonewall Riots in New York City in 1969. 32.市政厅后⾯的海伦娜-古特⾥奇⼴场 （Helena Gutteridge Plaza）曾是主会场。 33.⻓期担任联合教会牧师的前议员蒂姆-史蒂 ⽂森（Tim Stevenson）2018年告诉《温哥华 信使报》（Vancouver Courier），他在市政 厅后台阶上为⼀对新⼈举⾏了婚礼，作为纪念 1969年纽约市⽯墙暴动周年纪念仪式的⼀部 分。 34."We had the steps all painted in a rainbow, and it was wonderful," Stevenson said at the time. 34.史蒂⽂森当时说："我们把台阶都画成了彩 虹，那真是太棒了。" 35.'Just wasn't in the cards' 36.Watson and Cheah said it was inevitable they would get married in a country where one of them didn’t grow up. And they said linking their birthplaces together, along with Australia — where they met — and getting married in Vancouver has been “quite fun.” 35. "那是不可能的" 36.Watson 和 Cheah 说，他们不可避免地会 在其中⼀⼈没有⻓⼤的国家结婚。他们说，把 他们的出⽣地和澳⼤利亚（他们在那⾥相识） 联系在⼀起，并在温哥华结婚 "相当有趣"。 37.“If you told me five years ago that you would get married in Canada, it just wasn't in the cards — it would have been unexpected,” Watson said. 38.The couple shared that getting married in England would have also been more difficult than choosing a city hall wedding in Vancouver. 37.Watson说：“如果你在五年前告诉我，你们 会在加拿⼤结婚，那是不可能的—那会出乎我 的意料。” 38.这对新⼈还说，在英国结婚要⽐在温哥华 的市政厅举⾏婚礼更加困难。 39.“You have to be a resident [in England] for a week to register your intention to get married, and that has to be within the year before your wedding date,” Cheah said. 40.The process to get married at city hall, they said, was fairly smooth — there were some hiccups in confirming a date and time slot — and would recommend city hall for anyone planning a small wedding. 39.Cheah说：“你必须在[英国]居住⼀周才能 登记结婚，⽽且必须是在婚期前⼀年内。” 40.他们说，在市政厅举⾏婚礼的过程相当顺 利，只是在确认⽇期和时间段时有些⼩插曲， 他们会向任何计划举⾏⼩型婚礼的⼈推荐市政 厅。 41.“It’s a nice venue inside, and outside it’s a nice setting — and the weather's good today, as well,” said Watson, noting the city also provided information on best spots on the city hall campus for photographs. 42.“No complaints,” added Cheah. 41.沃森说：“⾥⾯的场地不错，外⾯的环境也 很好，今天的天⽓也不错。” 42. "没有抱怨，"Cheah 补充道。 43.The couple plans to honeymoon in Africa. 43.这对新⼈计划去⾮洲度蜜⽉。 语法和⻓句分析 • Paragraph 22: "The slots sell out the fastest in spring and summer, said Soumpassis in an email exchange this week. She said each ceremony is unique and memorable, whether it’s the non traditional outfits, music selection — everything from the Beatles to Bach — or personalized vows." • 解释： 这个句⼦描述了婚礼时间段销售情况及其特 点，包括⼀个主句和⼀个定语从句。主句说明 了婚礼时间段在春夏季节的销售情况，⽽定语 从句详细描述了每场婚礼的独特和难忘之处， 包括服装、⾳乐选择（从披头⼠乐队到巴 赫），以及个性化的誓⾔。 • Paragraph 25: "‘There were a few times where staff were asked to help the bride hide in the city hall building before the special moment,’ she said. ‘Without fail, when the bride pops out, there are always tears, big smiles and that energy is really palpable — it’s even sparked a few tears within our own team.’" • 解释： 这个句⼦通过直接引语表达了⼀种情感丰富 的场景。第⼀部分描述了⼯作⼈员帮助新娘隐藏的 情况，⽽第⼆部分通过增补语"Without fail, when the bride pops out, there are always tears, big smiles and that energy is really palpable"描述了新 娘出现时的感⼈场⾯，以及"it’s even sparked a few tears within our own team"强调了这种情感的影响 ⼒。 • Paragraph 27: "Staff has heard from couples that they assumed a city hall wedding would be the fastest, cheapest and easiest way to get married — an assumption driven by portrayals of weddings in Hollywood movies and television shows." • 解释： 这个句⼦包含了⼀个宾语从句，说明了新⼈ 对市政厅婚礼的⼀些假设，这些假设是由好莱坞电 影和电视剧中的婚礼描绘所驱动的。宾语从句详细 说明了⼈们认为市政厅婚礼是最快、最便宜、最简 单的结婚⽅式的原因。 • Paragraph 29: "Couples can choose between ceremonies of up to 10 people on Mondays at $302.50 plus GST, or up to 20 people available on other days of the week at $605 plus GST." • 解释： 这个句⼦描述了新⼈可以选择的两种婚礼⽅ 案，包括价格和⼈数限制，使⽤了并列结构来⽐较 两种选择，以及附加的消费税（GST）的信息。 • Paragraph 34: "‘We had the steps all painted in a rainbow, and it was wonderful,' Stevenson said at the time." • 解释： 这是⼀个简单句，包含了直接引语，描述了 ⼀次特别的婚礼场景，其中阶梯被漆成彩虹⾊，增 加了仪式的美感和意义。 • Paragraph 37: "‘If you told me five years ago that you would get married in Canada, it just wasn't in the cards — it would have been unexpected,’ Watson said." • 解释： 这是⼀个包含条件状语从句的复合句。条件 状语从句"If you told me five years ago that you would get married in Canada"设置了⼀个假设的情 景，⽽主句"it just wasn't in the cards — it would have been unexpected"表达了这种假设在五年前看 起来是不可能的，强调了事件的意外性。 ⽣词表 1.

### 个人感想


为这个总结写英语版本的总结
我的感想的中文是

关于婚礼的场景布置我倒是曾经思考过很多
但是没有考虑过在政府大楼这样的场所搞
太民主了吧哈哈哈



在我们大陆想都不敢想

我以为那边婚礼全是教堂牧师啥的
说实在的我也不信教

I've often pondered / _ˈpɒndəd_  over various/ _ˈveəriəs_ wedding scene arrangements  / _əˈreɪndʒmənts_ , but I never considered hosting one in a government building. It's quite democratic / _ˌdeməˈkrætɪk_, isn't it? Haha.
On our mainland, it's something we wouldn't even dare to think about. I had the impression that weddings over there were all about churches / _ˈtʃɜːtʃɪz_ and pastors/ _ˈpɑːstəz_ . Honestly, I'm not religious/ _rɪˈlɪdʒəs_.

-----


Your writing effectively introduces the concept of micro-weddings and reflects  / _rɪˈflekts_ on cultural differences in wedding traditions. The transition from discussing general trends / _trendz_ to your personal reflection is smooth, and the casual tone makes your writing engaging. However, there are a few areas where the organization could be slightly improved:

  

1. **Introduction of Personal Reflection**: The transition from the one-sentence summary to your personal reflection could be more seamless / _ˈsiːmləs_ . It might help to create a stronger connection between the couple’s choice of venue and your thoughts on the unconventional  / _ˌʌnkənˈvenʃənl_ setting.

2. **Cultural Comparison / _kəmˈpærɪs_**: While your reflection on cultural differences is interesting, it could be slightly expanded to clarify  / _ˈklærəfaɪ_ what “mainland” refers to and why government buildings are not considered for weddings in that context  / _ˈkɒntekst_ .




**Revised Version of Your Writing**

  

Weddings are significant milestones in one’s life. Given the challenges posed by the pandemic, it is understandable that many have chosen to opt for simpler, more intimate micro-weddings.

  

A couple from England and Malaysia, who recently moved to Vancouver, got married in a simple ceremony at Vancouver City Hall, which has become a popular venue for ‘micro-weddings’ since the pandemic.

  

I’ve often thought about different wedding venues, but I never considered the idea of hosting one in a government building. It’s quite democratic, isn’t it? Haha. On our mainland, it’s something we wouldn’t even dare to think about. I used to think weddings over there were mostly about churches and pastors. Honestly, though, I’m not religious, so this alternative  / _ɔːlˈtɜːnətɪv_  setting seems intriguing  / _ɪnˈtriːɡɪŋ_ to me.

老师的评语主要集中在两个方面：**个人反思的引入**和**文化比较的扩展**。以下是对这段评语的理解：


你的写作有效地介绍了微型婚礼的概念，并反映了婚礼传统中的文化差异。从讨论一般趋势到你的个人反思的过渡很顺畅，随意的语气使你的写作更具吸引力。然而，有几个地方的组织可以稍微改进一下


1. **个人反思的引入**：
   - 老师认为从总结到个人反思的过渡可以更加顺畅。建议在描述这对夫妇选择场地和你对这种非传统场地的看法之间建立更强的联系。

2. **文化比较**：
   - 老师觉得你对文化差异的反思很有趣，但可以稍微扩展一下，明确“mainland”指的是什么，以及为什么在那个背景下政府建筑不被考虑作为婚礼场地。

**改进后的版本**：

婚礼是人生中的重要里程碑。鉴于疫情带来的挑战，许多人选择了更简单、更亲密的微型婚礼。

一对来自英国和马来西亚的夫妇最近搬到温哥华，并在温哥华市政厅举行了简单的婚礼仪式。自疫情以来，市政厅已成为“微型婚礼”的热门场所。

我经常想到不同的婚礼场地，但从未考虑过在政府建筑中举办婚礼。这种选择相当民主，不是吗？哈哈。在我们的大陆，这几乎是不可想象的。我以前认为那里的婚礼主要是在教堂和牧师主持下进行的。说实话，我并不信教，所以这种另类的场地对我来说很有吸引力。

希望这些解释对你理解老师的评语有所帮助！如果你有任何问题或需要进一步的修改建议，请告诉我。
