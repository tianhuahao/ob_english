- 13."If you remember back in the 1960s, there were a lot of questions and concerns and fears that doctors had about expanding that coverage. And so anytime you're expanding coverage and creating something new, there's going to be some challenges." 14.Many dentists do not feel they have enough information at this point to sign up, said Carr, a practising dentist for 36 years. 13. "如果你还记得 20 世纪 60 年代，医⽣们 对扩⼤医疗保险覆盖⾯有很多疑问、担忧和恐 惧。因此，⽆论何时扩⼤覆盖范围和创造新事 物，都会遇到⼀些挑战.” 14.许多⽛医认为他们⽬前还没有⾜够的信息 来注册，⼀位从业 36 年的⽛医卡尔说。 15.The fact that they need to sign up in the first place is something oral care providers are not used to, she added, as dentists are used to dealing directly with patients. 16.If a dentist wants to wait for more information before signing up, they could lose patients, said Carr. 15.她补充说，⽛医习惯于直接与患者打交 道，因此他们⾸先需要注册这⼀事实是⼝腔护 理服务提供者所不习惯的。 16.卡尔说，如果⽛医想等待更多信息再签 约，他们可能会失去病⼈。 17."Your existing patient may not be able to see you anymore because there is no provision," she said, calling the overall design of the program "much more complicated than necessary." 18.Groups representing dentists and hygienists have raised concerns about Ottawa's pay structure, saying the proposed fees are lower than what patients are currently being billed. 17.她说："你现有的病⼈可能因为没有规定⽽ 不能再找你看病了。"她称该计划的整体设计 " ⽐必要的复杂得多"。 18.代表⽛医和卫⽣学家的团体对渥太华的薪 酬结构表示担忧，称拟议的收费低于⽬前向患 者收取的费⽤。 19.Dental associations have warned that some of their members are hesitant to participate in the program, citing billing concerns. 20.And in the meantime, patients are being told the dental-care program is completely free, Carr said, even though there could be "out-of-pocket expenses" in some cases. 19.⽛医协会警告说，他们的⼀些成员因担⼼ 账单问题⽽对参与该计划犹豫不决。 20.卡尔说，与此同时，病⼈被告知⽛科保健 计划是完全免费的，尽管在某些情况下可能会 有 "⾃付费⽤"。 21."But we're not able to be clear about it," she said. 22.Holland has characterized the proposed fees as "fair," but Dr. Carl Tremblay, president of Quebec's association of dental surgeons, sees it differently. 21.她说："但我们⽆法说清楚。" 22.霍兰将提议的收费定性为 "公平"，但魁北 克⽛科医⽣协会主席卡尔-特伦布莱博⼠（Dr. Carl Tremblay）却有不同看法。 23.The minister is essentially asking his members to "subsidize" the federal program by offering reduced rates to people who are eligible, Tremblay said. 24.Ottawa is "basically asking us for charity," he said, vowing to "continue to charge our regular rates" and rejecting the notion they are trying to negotiate their rates with the federal government. 23.Tremblay 说，部⻓实质上是在要求他的成 员"补贴"联邦计划，为符合条件的⼈提供减 价。 24.他说，渥太华 "基本上是在要求我们施舍 "，并誓⾔ "继续按正常价格收费"，拒绝接受 他们试图与联邦政府谈判价格的说法。 25.Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has not yet taken a public position on the program; his office has not yet responded to a media inquiry. 26.Holland said Nova Scotia MP and Conservative health critic Stephen Ellis has so far refused to meet to discuss the program. 25.保守党领袖⽪埃尔-波利耶夫尔（Pierre Poilievre）尚未就该计划公开表态；他的办公 室尚未回应媒体的询问。 26.霍兰说，新斯科舍省国会议员、保守党卫 ⽣评论员斯蒂芬-埃利斯（Stephen Ellis）⾄ 今拒绝会⾯讨论该计划。 语法和⻓句分析 1.第1句: "OTTAWA — Dentists cannot participate in a national dental-care plan unless they know exactly how it will work, Heather Carr, president of the Canadian Dental Association, said Wednesday." 这是⼀个复合句。主句是"Heather Carr, president of the Canadian Dental Association, said Wednesday"，宾语从句 是"Dentists cannot participate in a national dental-care plan unless they know exactly how it will work"，其中使⽤了条件 状语从句"unless they know exactly how it will work"来表达参 与计划的前提条件。 2.第3句: "Carr, whose organization represents provincial and territorial dental associations, said the federal program needs to get it right before registered seniors can start using it next month." 这是⼀个复杂句，包括⼀个定语从句"whose organization represents provincial and territorial dental associations"修 饰"Carr"。主句是"Carr said the federal program needs to get it right before registered seniors can start using it next month"，包括⼀个时间状语从句"before registered seniors can start using it next month"描述何时开始使⽤该计划。 3.第9句: "Health Minister Mark Holland insisted on Wednesday that the government is working to address dentists' concerns by making it easier to participate without having to officially enrol, and expects to see 'huge participation.'" 这句话是⼀个复杂句，主句是"Health Minister Mark Holland insisted on Wednesday"，宾语从句是"the government is working to address dentists' concerns by making it easier to participate without having to officially enrol, and expects to see 'huge participation'"，其中使⽤了⽅式状语从句"by making it easier to participate without having to officially enrol"来解释政府如何解决⽛医的担忧。 4.第13句: "If you remember back in the 1960s, there were a lot of questions and concerns and fears that doctors had about expanding that coverage." 这句话是条件状语从句"If you remember back in the 1960s"加上⼀个主句"there were a lot of questions and concerns and fears that doctors had about expanding that coverage"，其中宾语从句"that doctors had about expanding that coverage"说明医⽣们对扩展保险覆盖的担⼼。 5.第17句: "Your existing patient may not be able to see you anymore because there is no provision," she said, calling the overall design of the program "much more complicated than necessary." 这是⼀个复合句。主句是"She said"，直接引语是"Your existing patient may not be able to see you anymore because there is no provision"，这⾥包含⼀个原因状语从 句"because there is no provision"。句尾的分词结构"calling the overall design of the program 'much more complicated than necessary'"作为伴随状语，描述了她的评价。 6.第24句: "Ottawa is 'basically asking us for charity,' he said, vowing to 'continue to charge our regular rates' and rejecting the notion they are trying to negotiate their rates with the federal government." 这个复合句包括多个部分。主句是"He said"，直接引语 是"Ottawa is 'basically asking us for charity,'"，此外还包括两 个并列的分词结构："vowing to 'continue to charge our regular rates'" 和 "rejecting the notion they are trying to negotiate their rates with the federal government"，分别表 示承诺和拒绝的动作。 ⽣词表 • Participate [ˌpɑːrˈtɪsɪˌpeɪt] • English: To take part or become involved in an activity. • Chinese: 参与，参加 • Insisted [ɪnˈsɪstɪd] • English: To demand something forcefully, not accepting refusal. • Chinese: 坚持，强调 • Concerns [kənˈsɜːrnz] • English: Worries or matters of interest. • Chinese: 关⼼，担忧 • Enrol [ɛnˈroʊl] • English: To officially register as a member of an institution or a student on a course. • Chinese: 注册，登记 • Negotiation [nɪˌɡoʊʃiˈeɪʃən] • English: Discussion aimed at reaching an agreement. • Chinese: 谈判，协商 • Provision [prəˈvɪʒən] • English: The action of providing or supplying something for use. • Chinese: 提供，供应 • Complicated [ˈkɑːmplɪˌkeɪtɪd] • English: Consisting of many interconnecting parts or elements;
