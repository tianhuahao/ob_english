> 渥太华 — 加拿⼤医学协会（Canadian Medical Association）要求联邦政府重新考虑 资本利得税改⾰提案，认为这将影响医⽣的退 休储蓄。 
- 该协会主席凯瑟琳-罗斯（Kathleen Ross） 说，许多医⽣将他们的医疗机构注册为公司， 并在公司内部进⾏退休投资。
----
- The proposed changes would increase taxes / _ˈtæksɪz_ on those investments, something the association says will add “financial strain” for doctors who do not have a pension / _ˈpenʃn_ to rely on. 
- Ross argues the change could also affect recruitment and retention of physicians in Canada.

- 拟议的修改将增加这些投资的税收，该协会 称，这将给没有养⽼⾦可依赖的医⽣增加 “经 济压⼒”。 
- 罗斯认为，这⼀变化也会影响加拿⼤医⽣的 招聘和留⽤。

- 5.Doctors are the latest group to come out against the tax change, which is expected to largely affect wealthier Canadians and businesses. 
- The federal budget presented last week proposes making two-thirds rather than one half of capital gains — or profit made on the sale of assets — taxable.

- 医⽣是最新⼀个站出来反对税改的群体，预 计税改将在很⼤程度上影响较富裕的加拿⼤⼈ 和企业。 
- 上周提交的联邦预算建议将资本收益（或出 售资产所得利润）的三分之⼆⽽不是⼆分之⼀ 征税。

- 7.The increase in the so-called inclusion rate would apply to capital gains above $250,000 for individuals, and all capital gains realized by corporations. 8.“We have seen this portrayed by the government as tax fairness for every generation. But realistically, there are certain members of the population that are going to be more impacted,” Ross said in an interview. 7.所谓含税税率的提⾼将适⽤于个⼈超过 25 万美元的资本收益，以及公司实现的所有资本 收益。 8. "我们看到政府将此描述为每⼀代⼈的税收 公平。罗斯在接受采访时说："但实际上，⼈ ⼝中的某些成员受到的影响会更⼤。 9.Ross pointed out that doctors would not be eligible for the $250,000 exemption to the higher inclusion rate, since the investments they make are largely inside corporations. 10.The Liberal government has argued that the tax change is about levelling the playing f ield between those who earn income through capital gains versus employment.  9.罗斯指出，医⽣将没有资格享受 25 万澳元 的⾼含税率豁免，因为他们的投资主要是在公 司内部进⾏的。 10.⾃由党政府辩称，此次税改是为了在通过 资本利得赚取收⼊的⼈与通过就业赚取收⼊的 ⼈之间创造公平的竞争环境。 11.Economists in favour of the change say that increasing the inclusion rate improves the tax system by making sure all types of income are taxed similarly. 12.The Liberal government is also selling the change as a way to make the wealthy pay more to support things like housing and health care for all Canadians. 11.⽀持这⼀变⾰的经济学家表示，提⾼包含 税率可以确保对所有类型的收⼊征收类似的 税，从⽽改善税收制度。 12.⾃由党政府还将这⼀变化作为⼀种让富⼈ ⽀付更多税款的⽅式来推销，以⽀持所有加拿 ⼤⼈的住房和医疗保健等事业。 13.As a result of the capital gains tax change, the federal government estimates only 0.13 per cent of Canadians with an average income of $1.4 million are expected to pay more in taxes in any given year.  14.But Ross pushed back on the idea that doctors are highly-paid. 13.由于资本利得税的改变，联邦政府估计平 均收⼊为140万加元的加拿⼤⼈中，只有 0.13%的⼈在任何⼀年中会多交税。 14.但罗斯反驳了医⽣⾼薪的说法。 15.“I need to combat the messaging that physicians are highly paid, given the extensive years of their professional training. And the fact that we graduate with substantial debt,” Ross said.  16.According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, the average gross income per physician in 2022 was $357,000. Self-employed doctors also have to pay for overhead costs such as rent and staff salaries from that amount. 15. "鉴于医⽣接受了多年的专业培训，我需要 消除医⽣⾼薪的信息。事实上，我们毕业时都 背负着巨额债务，"罗斯说。 16.根据加拿⼤卫⽣信息研究所（Canadian Institute for Health Information）的数据， 2022年每位医⽣的平均总收⼊为35.7万美 元。⾃营职业的医⽣还必须从这笔收⼊中⽀付 房租和员⼯⼯资等管理费⽤。 17.Physicians can still invest in a Registered Retirement Savings Plan — which is tax advantaged — so long as they pay themselves a salary out of their corporation. 18.During a news conference on Tuesday, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland was asked about the pushback from doctors.  17.医⽣仍然可以投资于注册退休储蓄计划 （Registered Retirement Savings Plan）--这 是⼀种税收优惠计划--只要他们从⾃⼰的公司 中为⾃⼰⽀付⼯资即可。 18.在周⼆的新闻发布会上，财政部⻓克⾥斯 蒂娅-弗⾥兰（Chrystia Freeland）被问及医 ⽣们的反对意⻅。 19.She responded by highlighting how much the government has spent on health care, including money earmarked in the budget for pharmacare, dental care and student loan forgiveness for doctors working in rural communities. 20.“I think Canada’s health-care professionals recognize, maybe more than anyone else, how important these investments are,” said Freeland. 19.她在回答时强调了政府在医疗保健⽅⾯的 投⼊，包括在预算中指定⽤于药剂保健、⽛科 保健和免除在农村社区⼯作的医⽣的学⽣贷 款。 20.弗⾥兰说：”我认为，加拿⼤的医疗保健专 业⼈员也许⽐任何⼈都更清楚这些投资有多么 重要。 21.“They are massive and I think it’s entirely appropriate, it’s really fair to ask those who are doing the best in our society to pay a little bit more to fund them.” 22.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was also asked at a news conference about the request from physicians to reconsider the tax change. 21.弗⾥兰说：”这些投资是巨⼤的，我认为要 求那些在我们的社会中做得最好的⼈为这些投 资多付⼀点钱是完全合适的，也是⾮常公平 的。 22.总理贾斯汀-特鲁多（Justin Trudeau）也 在新闻发布会上被问及医⽣们要求重新考虑税 收变化的问题。 23.His response overlooked the concern from doctors that all of their investments would be subject to a higher inclusion rate because they are made through their incorporated business. 24.“We need young people to be confident about the future,” he said. 23.他的回答忽略了医⽣们的担忧，即他们的 所有投资都将被征收更⾼的包含税率，因为这 些投资都是通过他们注册成⽴的企业进⾏的。 24.他说："我们需要年轻⼈对未来充满信⼼ "。 25.“So yes, we are asking the most successful in this country to do a little bit more.” 25. “所以，是的，我们要求这个国家最成功的 ⼈做得更多⼀点。” 语法和⻓句分析 1. 第2段 • 原句：Kathleen Ross, the association’s president, says many doctors incorporate their medical practices and invest for retirement inside their corporations. • 分析：这是⼀个包含主句和宾语从句的句⼦。主句 是 "Kathleen Ross, the association’s president, says"，宾语从句是 "many doctors incorporate their medical practices and invest for retirement inside their corporations”。 2. 第3段 • 原句：The proposed changes would increase taxes on those investments, something the association says will add “financial strain” for doctors who do not have a pension to rely on. • 分析：这个句⼦包含主句和定语从句。主句是 "The proposed changes would increase taxes on those investments"，定语从句部分是 "something the association says will add 'financial strain' for doctors who do not have a pension to rely on”。 3. 第6段 • 原句：The federal budget presented last week proposes making two-thirds rather than one-half of capital gains — or profit made on the sale of assets — taxable. • 分析：这个句⼦包含主句和插⼊语。主句是 "The federal budget presented last week proposes making two-thirds rather than one-half of capital gains taxable"，插⼊语 "or profit made on the sale of assets" 解释了资本利得的来源。 4. 第8段 • 原句：“We have seen this portrayed by the government as tax fairness for every generation.

## The relationship between the parties and the context of the incident

Sure, let me break it down for you:

1. **Canadian Medical Association (CMA)**: This is a professional organization representing doctors in Canada. They are concerned about proposed changes to capital gains taxation.
    
2. **Proposed Tax Changes**: The federal government wants to increase the portion of capital gains that are taxable from 50% to 66.67%. For individuals, this applies to gains above $250,000, but for corporations, it applies to all gains.
    
3. **Impact on Doctors**: Many doctors incorporate their practices and invest for retirement within these corporations. The CMA argues that the increased taxes on these investments will add financial strain on doctors, who often don’t have traditional pensions. [This could also make it harder to recruit and retain doctors in Canada](https://www.cma.ca/latest-stories/capital-gains-tax-proposal-will-hurt-health-care-canada-heres-how-cma-advocating-change)[1](https://www.cma.ca/latest-stories/capital-gains-tax-proposal-will-hurt-health-care-canada-heres-how-cma-advocating-change)[2](https://globalnews.ca/news/10443557/capital-gains-tax-budget-2024-cma/).
    
4. **Government’s Perspective**: The government believes this change will make the tax system fairer by ensuring that income from capital gains is taxed more like regular income. [They argue that the wealthiest Canadians should contribute more to fund public services like healthcare and housing](https://www.cma.ca/latest-stories/capital-gains-tax-proposal-will-hurt-health-care-canada-heres-how-cma-advocating-change)[2](https://globalnews.ca/news/10443557/capital-gains-tax-budget-2024-cma/).
    
5. **Doctors’ Counterargument**: The CMA and its president, Kathleen Ross, argue that doctors are not as wealthy as portrayed, considering their long years of training and substantial debt. [They also point out that doctors’ investments through corporations won’t benefit from the $250,000 exemption](https://www.cma.ca/latest-stories/capital-gains-tax-proposal-will-hurt-health-care-canada-heres-how-cma-advocating-change)[1](https://www.cma.ca/latest-stories/capital-gains-tax-proposal-will-hurt-health-care-canada-heres-how-cma-advocating-change)[2](https://globalnews.ca/news/10443557/capital-gains-tax-budget-2024-cma/).
    
6. **Government’s Response**: Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have defended the changes, emphasizing the need for those who are doing well to contribute more to public services. [They also highlighted other investments in healthcare, such as student loan forgiveness for doctors in rural areas](https://globalnews.ca/news/10443557/capital-gains-tax-budget-2024-cma/)[2](https://globalnews.ca/news/10443557/capital-gains-tax-budget-2024-cma/).
    

In summary, the CMA is worried that the proposed tax changes will financially burden doctors and affect healthcare recruitment, while the government argues that the changes are necessary for tax fairness and funding public services.

Does this help clarify the situation?

当然，让我为你翻译一下：

1. **加拿大医学协会 (CMA)**：这是一个代表加拿大医生的专业组织。他们对拟议的资本利得税变化表示担忧。

2. **拟议的税收变化**：联邦政府希望将应纳税的资本利得部分从50%增加到66.67%。对于个人，这适用于超过25万加元的收益，但对于公司，这适用于所有收益。

3. **对医生的影响**：许多医生将他们的诊所注册为公司，并在这些公司内进行退休投资。CMA认为，增加这些投资的税收将给没有传统养老金的医生带来财务压力。这也可能使加拿大的医生招聘和留任变得更加困难。

4. **政府的观点**：政府认为，这一变化将使税收系统更加公平，确保资本利得收入像普通收入一样被征税。他们认为，最富有的加拿大人应该为公共服务（如医疗保健和住房）贡献更多。

5. **医生的反驳**：CMA及其主席凯瑟琳·罗斯认为，考虑到医生的长期培训和大量债务，医生并不像被描绘的那样富有。他们还指出，通过公司进行的医生投资将无法享受25万加元的豁免。

6. **政府的回应**：财政部长克里斯蒂亚·弗里兰和总理贾斯廷·特鲁多为这些变化进行了辩护，强调那些做得好的人需要为公共服务贡献更多。他们还强调了在医疗保健方面的其他投资，例如为在农村地区工作的医生提供学生贷款减免。

总之，CMA担心拟议的税收变化会给医生带来财务负担并影响医疗保健的招聘，而政府则认为这些变化对于税收公平和资助公共服务是必要的。

这是否有助于澄清情况？



## Summarizing & Perception

The topic discussed this time is a very sensitive one, concerning the issue of employee pensions. I have also been paying attention to similar issues, such as reports suggesting that retirement in Singapore is solely dependent on one's self, earning money when young and spending it in old age. The first paragraph of the article piqued my curiosity: Register medical institutions as companies? Investing in pensions in advance? I had never thought of that.
