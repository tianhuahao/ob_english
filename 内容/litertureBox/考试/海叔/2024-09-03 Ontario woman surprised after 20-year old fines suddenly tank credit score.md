- 安⼤略省⼀名妇⼥说，20年前的罚款让她上 周的信⽤评分突然⽔涨船⾼，令她⼤吃⼀惊。 
- 丽莎-普罗瑟（Lisa Prosser）现年 38 岁， 上周⼀，她的信⽤评分上⾸次出现了⼏个贬损 标记，这与 1000 加元的未付罚款有关。 3.“I pay all my bills. So I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, what is this?’” she told CTV News Toronto. 4.Prosser said she checks her credit score regularly, and came across the untimely fines as she was conducting a check in preparation to sell her house in Windsor, Ont. Her mortgage payments had increased $500 per month, making moving in with her mother-in-law in Toronto and consolidating finances a necessity. 3. "我⽀付了所有的账单。她告诉多伦多 CTV 新闻。" 4.普罗瑟说，她定期检查⾃⼰的信⽤评分，在 准备出售⾃⼰位于安⼤略省温莎市的房⼦时， 她发现了这些不合时宜的罚款。她的按揭付款 每⽉增加了 500 加元，因此她不得不搬到多 伦多的婆婆家居住，并整合财务。 5.The fines, added to her report on December 15, 2023, were from the City of Toronto. But after calling around to government offices and collection agencies, Prosser learned that three offences dated back to when she was 17 years old, and another two to when she was 22 years old, and living in Toronto. 6.Details on the offences were limited, listing brief descriptions, such as vending prohibited, keep, sell or offer liquor, no licence, and health protection act. Beyond these labels, Prosser has no idea what the fines are for and the only way she can find out is by visiting a Toronto courthouse, she said. 5.2023年12⽉15⽇，多伦多市政府对她进⾏ 了罚款。但在打电话给政府办公室和收款机构 后，普罗瑟了解到，有三项违法⾏为可以追溯 到她 17 岁时，另外两项可以追溯到她 22 岁 时，当时她住在多伦多。 6.关于这些违法⾏为的细节⾮常有限，只是列 出了⼀些简单的描述，如禁⽌售货、保存、出 售或提供酒类、⽆执照以及健康保护法。除了 这些标签之外，普罗瑟不知道这些罚款是⽤来 ⼲什么的，她说，唯⼀的办法就是去多伦多法 院了解情况。 7.“It could be applied for jaywalking, drinking in the park … it could be anything like that, like, who knows?” Prosser said. 8.Prosser said that Financial Debt Recovery (FDR), one of the collection agencies assigned to the case, told her that they had attempted sending notices to the address on file. But Prosser had not lived in that house for decades. 7. "它可能适⽤于乱穿⻢路、在公园⾥喝 酒......可能是任何类似的情况，⽐如，谁知道 呢？"普罗瑟说。 8.普罗瑟说，负责此案的收账机构之⼀ Financial Debt Recovery (FDR) 告诉她，他 们曾试图向档案中的地址发送通知。但 Prosser 已经有⼏⼗年没有住在那所房⼦⾥ 了。 9.“How can you put this on my credit report when you actually never contacted me? I'm not hiding. I got a valid driver's license. I worked for the school board,” she told CTV News Toronto. 10.While Prosser wished the city did more to track her down, insolvency trustee Samantha Galea said provincial and municipal fines are not statute-barred, which means there’s no limit on how long creditors have to pursue collections. 9. "你们从未联系过我，怎么能把这些记在我 的信⽤报告上？我没有隐瞒。我有有效的驾 照。我在学校董事会⼯作过。"她对多伦多 CTV 新闻说。 10.虽然普罗瑟希望市政府能做更多的事情来 追踪她，但破产受托⼈萨曼莎-加莱雅 （Samantha Galea）表示，省级和市级罚款 不受法律限制，这意味着债权⼈追讨的时间没 有限制。 11.“This is a type of debt that will never go away,” Galea said. 12.“Even if it's been 20 years, or 30 years or 50 years since this person incurred the debt, it's not going to be statute barred, so it is collectible.” 11.Galea说："这是⼀种永远不会消失的债 务。" 12. "即使这个⼈的债务已经过去了 20 年、 30 年或 50 年，也不会超过法定时效，因此是 可以追讨的。" 13.Michael Famutimi, head of FDR’s legal department, said the onus is ultimately on the individual to update creditors if they move residences. 14.“Similar to student loans, which can be a municipal debt, they don’t cease to exist because of the passage of time,” Famutimi said. 13.FDR法律部⻔负责⼈迈克尔-法穆蒂⽶ （Michael Famutimi）表示，如果个⼈搬家， 最终应由个⼈负责向债权⼈提供最新信息。 14. “与学⽣贷款类似，学⽣贷款也可以是市政 债务，它们不会因为时间的流逝⽽不复存 在，”Famutimi 说。 15.He explained the City of Toronto likely assigned FDR to collect this debt in December, hence the recent date on Prosser’s report. 16.With provincial and municipal fines, Galea said, “They (collectors) don’t really have to prove anything. They don't have to really even necessarily prove that they reached out because the statute of limitations doesn't apply.” 15.他解释说，多伦多市政府很可能是在12⽉ 指派FDR来追讨这笔债务的，因此普罗瑟报告 上的⽇期是最近的。 16.对于省级和市级罚款，Galea 说："他们 （收款⼈）其实不需要证明什么。他们甚⾄不 ⼀定要证明他们联系过对⽅，因为诉讼时效并 不适⽤。" 17.She suspects the city recently assigned Prosser’s file to a collection agency because it needs the money in the wake of a long pause on collections during the pandemic. 18.According to a City of Toronto spokesperson, Provincial Offences Act fines permanently remain on file, since they are considered Crown debt. Some fines even date back to the 1970s when they were transferred from the provincial government to the municipalities. 17.她怀疑市政府最近将普罗瑟的档案交给了 ⼀家收款机构，因为在⼤流⾏病期间，收款⼯ 作暂停了很⻓时间，市政府需要这笔钱。 18.据多伦多市政府发⾔⼈称，《省犯罪法》 的罚款永久保留在档案中，因为它们被视为官 ⽅债务。有些罚款甚⾄可以追溯到 20 世纪 70 年代，当时这些罚款由省政府移交给市政 府。 19.As of September 2023, there were more t han two million cases valued at approximately $575 million in outstanding fines, the city added. 20.Under pressure with her imminent home sale, Prosser felt the only way to resolve the issue was to pay the fine. “I need to get it off my reports. It's the only choice I have,” she said. 19.该市补充说，截⾄2023年9⽉，有超过200 万宗案件的未付罚款价值约为5.75亿加元。 20.迫于即将卖房的压⼒，普罗瑟觉得只有⽀ 付罚款才能解决问题。“我需要把它从我的报 告中删除。这是我唯⼀的选择，"她说。 21.She has a hunch at least one of the fines is fraudulent, the one pertaining to the health act. “I was 17 years old. I don't remember doing anything,” she said. 22.But to find out, she’ll have to pay a visit to Toronto, which she’s aiming to do next week. “If I feel it's fraudulent, I’ll file an appeal or a dispute,” she said. 21.她直觉⾄少有⼀项罚款是欺诈性的，那就 是与健康法案有关的罚款。“我当时 17 岁。我 不记得⾃⼰做了什么，"她说。 22.但要想知道真相，她必须去多伦多⼀趟， 她打算下周去。她说："如果我觉得是欺诈， 我会提出上诉或争议。" 语法和⻓句分析 1.
