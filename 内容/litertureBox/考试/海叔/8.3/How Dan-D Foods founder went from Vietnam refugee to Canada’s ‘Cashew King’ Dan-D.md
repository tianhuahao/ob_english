He said, ‘Well, this is it. Let’s come back to Vietnam to open a cashew factory,’” recalled On, who knew nothing about cashews at the time. 16.“I said, ‘Okay, let’s do it, give it a shot. But if I do cashews, I will do the best quality cashews.’” 15. "我⽗亲喜欢腰果。他说，'好吧，就是它 了。“当时对腰果⼀⽆所知的 On 回忆道。 16. "我说，'好吧，就这么办，试试看。但如 果我做腰果，我就做质量最好的腰果。 17.And it turned out to be a huge success.

[Others] followed us —tens of different brands are competing with us. But that’s fine—we welcome competition because competition is also giving us opportunity to do better and keep reinventing ourselves,” said On. 17.结果⼤获成功。当时，市场上的腰果并不 多，⽽且⼤部分来⾃东⾮。Dan D 的腰果包 装产品在加拿⼤和亚洲都很受欢迎，为公司未 来的成功和扩张奠定了基础。 18.我们是腰果之王。我们是⾏业先锋。[其他 ⼈]追随我们—数⼗个不同的品牌与我们竞 争。但这很好，我们欢迎竞争，因为竞争也给 了我们做得更好、不断⾃我⾰新的机会。

总结 Summarize  / _ˈsʌməraɪz_

感悟 perception  / _pəˈsepʃn_


我看到今日文章第一段很好奇，我的认知是越南应该是腰果原产地，加拿大应该是进口商

所以我猜测应该是关于如何配合加拿大贸易政策把越南的腰果卖往加拿大，还要考虑关税，这样加拿大人就能吃上价格低廉品质好的越南腰果，我想越南腰果配上加拿大当地枫糖浆，烘烤后肯定非常美味

I was intrigued by the first paragraph of today's article. My understanding is that Vietnam is the origin of cashews, while Canada is an importer. Therefore, I speculate that the article discusses how to align with Canadian trade policies to sell Vietnamese cashews to Canada, taking into account tariffs. This way, Canadians can enjoy high-quality Vietnamese cashews at affordable prices. I believe that Vietnamese cashews paired with local Canadian maple syrup and roasted would be incredibly delicious.
