Supreme Court in April last year, alleging that the non-profit did not ensure the building met fire safety standards. 14." Two years ago this was my home, I miss my home," Hansma said. "I miss my cat. My cat died here because of neglect.” 13.在温特斯酒店居住了五年的詹妮弗-汉斯玛 （Jennifer Hansma）于去年四⽉向不列颠哥 伦⽐亚省最⾼法院提起了针对阿蒂拉的⺠事诉 讼，指控这家⾮营利性机构没有确保该建筑符 合消防安全标准。 14.汉斯玛说："两年前，这⾥还是我的家，我 想念我的家。"我想念我的猫。我的猫因为被 忽视⽽死在这⾥。 15.In response to the accusations, Atira said over the last two years, it has established monthly inspections of many of its SROs and trained staff and residents on f ire safety.  16."[We have] established an external safety task force that conducts monthly inspections in all the all-gender SROs," the non-profit said in a statement to CBC.  15.针对这些指控，阿提拉公司表示，在过去 两年⾥，公司对许多⾃救组织进⾏了⽉度检 查，并对员⼯和居⺠进⾏了消防安全培训。 16.该⾮营利组织在给 CBC 的⼀份声明中说： "[我们]已经成⽴了⼀个外部安全⼯作组，每⽉ 对所有性别的⾃⼒更⽣组织进⾏检查。" 17.Months after the Winters Hotel fire, Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth had ordered a coroner's inquest into the two deaths at the hotel. 18.In February, the coroner's inquest heard that sprinklers in the building didn't work because they hadn't been reset after a smaller fire three days earlier.  17.温特斯酒店⽕灾发⽣数⽉后，公共安全部 ⻓迈克-法恩沃斯（Mike Farnworth）下令验 ⼫官对酒店的两起死亡事件进⾏调查。 18.今年 2 ⽉，验⼫官在调查中发现，⼤楼内 的⾃动喷⽔灭⽕装置不起作⽤，因为它们在三 天前的⼀场较⼩⽕灾后没有重新设置。 1 9. The inquest jury made 25 recommendations addressed to B.C. Housing, the Ministry of Public Safety, the City of Vancouver, the provincial Housing Ministry, the Vancouver Police Department, Vancouver Coastal Health and Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services. 20.The recommendations to B.C. Housing include making lease agreements that hold building operators to higher standards than minimum fire code requirements. 19.死因调查陪审团向 B.C. 省住房部、公共安 全部、温哥华市政府、省住房部、温哥华警察 局、温哥华海岸卫⽣局以及温哥华消防和救援 服务局提出了 25 项建议。 20.向 B.C. Housing 提出的建议包括签订租赁 协议，要求建筑运营商遵守⽐最低消防法规要 求更⾼的标准。 21.In a statement to CBC, Atira said it "acknowledges and supports 100 per cent of the recommendations from the inquest jury." 21.Atira在给CBC的⼀份声明中说，它 "承认 并100%⽀持调查陪审团的建议"。 语法和⻓句分析 第1段: "Housing advocates and former residents of a Vancouver hotel that burned to the ground leaving two people dead marked the second anniversary of the tragedy on Thursday and called for fire safety improvements in the area's buildings." • 主语（Subject）：Housing advocates and former residents • 谓语（Verb）：marked, called • 定语从句（Attributive Clause）：that burned to the ground leaving two people dead，修饰 Vancouver hotel • 并列句（Compound Sentence）：连接了两个动作 marked 和 called 第3段: "Dennis Guay and Mary Ann Garlow were found dead, and f ive others were taken to hospital in the aftermath of the fire, which Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services (VFRS) said was started by unattended candles." • 主语（Subject）：Dennis Guay and Mary Ann Garlow, f ive others • 谓语（Verb）：were found, were taken • 定语从句（Attributive Clause）：which Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services (VFRS) said was started by unattended candles，修饰先⾏词 fire 第7段: "The Winters Hotel blaze was one of a series of devastating f ires in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside and surrounding area over the last few years, which have caused growing alarm among residents in the neighbourhood." • 主语（Subject）：The Winters Hotel blaze • 谓语（Verb）：was • 定语从句（Attributive Clause）：which have caused growing alarm among residents in the neighbourhood， 修饰前⾯整个描述⽕灾的状况 第9段: "According to a report to the Vancouver City Council last year, there were 146 SRO buildings operating as of January 2023, with around 6,500 rooms." • 主语（Subject）：there • 谓语（Verb）：were • 状语（Adverbial）：According to a report to the Vancouver City Council last year，说明信息来源 • 介词短语（Prepositional Phrase）：with around 6,500 rooms，提供额外信息 第13段: "Jennifer Hansma, who lived at the Winters for five years, f iled a civil lawsuit against Atira in B.C.
