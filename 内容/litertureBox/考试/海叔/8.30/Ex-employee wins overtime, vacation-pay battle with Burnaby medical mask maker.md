- Two 'linked' companies, including one launched in Burnaby during the COVID pandemic to produce N95 medical masks, have been ordered to pay a $2,000 employment standards fine and $51,941.82 in unpaid wages and vacation pay to a former employee. 2.From Sept. 13, 2021 to June 26, 2022, Christine Kanno worked in human resources at Vitacore Industries Inc., a medical mask company incorporated two months after the COVID-19 pandemic was declared, according to a ruling by the Employment Standards Tribunal Tuesday. 1.两家“关联”公司，包括在新冠肺炎疫情期间 在本拿⽐成⽴的⼀家⽣产N95医⽤⼝罩的公 司，已被勒令向⼀名前雇员⽀付2000加元的 就业标准罚款和51941.82加元的未付⼯资和 假期⼯资。 2.根据就业标准法庭周⼆的裁决，从2021年9 ⽉13⽇到2022年6⽉26⽇，Christine Kanno 在Vitacore Industries Inc.的⼈⼒资源部⻔⼯ 作，这是⼀家在新冠肺炎疫情宣布两个⽉后成 ⽴的医⽤⼝罩公司。 3.She worked at Absolute Building Science Strata Engineering Inc. from June 27, 2022 to August 10, 2022, at which time she was terminated "for reasons related to the economic circumstances of the business," the ruling said. 4.Kanno complained to the tribunal about the two companies, saying they had violated the Employment Standards Act by not paying her overtime. 3.裁决称，她于2022年6⽉27⽇⾄2022年8⽉ 10⽇在Absolute Building Science Strata Engineering Inc.⼯作，当时她“因与企业经济 状况有关的原因”被解雇了。 4.Kanno向仲裁庭投诉这两家公司，称它们违 反了《就业标准法》，没有向她⽀付加班费。 5.The director of employment standards found in her favour, ruling the companies were "associated employers" and were "jointly and severally liable" to pay Kanno $51,941.82 in unpaid overtime and vacation pay. 6.The director also ordered the companies to pay a $2,000 fine for violating four provisions of the Employment Standards Act, according to the ruling. 5.就业标准局局⻓做出了对她有利的裁决，裁 定这两家公司为 “关联雇主”，应 “连带责任 ” 向 Kanno ⽀付 51,941.82 加元的未付加班费 和假期⼯资。 6.根据裁决，局⻓还命令这两家公司⽀付 2000 加元的罚款，因为它们违反了《就业标 准法》的四项规定。 7.'Symbiotic relationship' 8.The companies appealed the decision to the tribunal, arguing the director had erred in law by treating them as "associated employers.” 7.“共⽣关系” 8.这两家公司就裁决向仲裁庭提出上诉，辩称 局⻓将他们视为 “关联雇主 ”在法律上有误。 9.They said they were "engaged in very different businesses." 10.Vitacore, which originally had two plants in the South Slope area but has since moved operations to Port Coquitlam, makes medical masks, while Strata Engineering is a consulting engineering firm specializing in building science, building envelope, structural, mechanical and geotechnical engineering. 9.他们说，他们 “从事的是完全不同的业务”。 10.Vitacore公司原本在南坡地区有两家⼯⼚， 但后来将业务迁⾄⾼贵林港，该公司⽣产医⽤ ⼝罩，⽽Strata⼯程公司是⼀家⼯程咨询公 司，专⻔从事建筑科学、建筑围护结构、结 构、机械和岩⼟⼯程。 11.But tribunal member David Stevenson concluded the evidence clearly showed the companies – although incorporated at different times – were closely linked in a joint initiative to make medical masks while Kanno worked there. 12.“The two entities shared staff and resources and regularly 'charged back' wages; expenses were shared between the two entities," Stevenson said in his ruling. "The two entities were in a symbiotic relationship.” 11.但仲裁庭成员⼤卫-史蒂⽂森（David Stevenson）得出结论认为，证据清楚地表 明，这两家公司虽然成⽴于不同时期，但在 Kanno ⼯作期间，在⽣产医⽤⼝罩的联合⾏ 动中有着密切的联系。 12.史蒂⽂森在裁决中说：“两个实体共享员⼯ 和资源，并定期’扣回’⼯资；费⽤由两个实体 分担。”“两个实体之间是⼀种共⽣关系。” 13.Stevenson noted Vitacore and Strata Engineering also shared two directors, Yang Fei and Mikhail Moore, who made "key decisions" relating to the control and direction of the two companies, including creating Vitacore, and sharing resources, facilities, and employees, including Kanno. 14.Moore, who has given numerous media interviews as Vitacore's president, told employment standards that Strata Engineering was the lead in creating Vitacore in conjunction with Health Canada and others to produce N95 respirators. 13.Stevenson 指出，Vitacore 和 Strata Engineering 还共享两名董事，即 Yang Fei 和 Mikhail Moore，他们做出了与两家公司的 控制和⽅向有关的 “关键决定”，包括创建 Vitacore，共享资源、设施和员⼯，包括 Kanno。 14.Moore 曾多次以 Vitacore 总裁的身份接受 媒体采访，他告诉就业标准局，Strata ⼯程公 司是与加拿⼤卫⽣部和其他公司联合创建 Vitacore 公司⽣产 N95 呼吸器的牵头⼈。 15.”He says Vitacore was sort of like Strata Engineering’s 'child,'" stated the ruling. 16.WorkSafeBC fine 15.他说 Vitacore 就像是 Strata Engineering 的'孩⼦'。 16.WorkSafeBC罚款 17.At its height, Vitacore had 100 workers, 90 per cent of whom worked on the floor of the manufacturing plants, according to the ruling. 18.Worker safety was an issue at the factories early on, according to WorkSafeBC documents obtained by the NOW last year. 17.裁决书称，Vitacore公司在鼎盛时期有100 名⼯⼈，其中90%在⽣产⻋间的地⾯上⼯作。 18.据《新闻报》去年获得的 WorkSafeBC ⽂ 件显示，⼯⼈安全在⼯⼚早期就是⼀个问题。 19.Vitacore was fined more than $13,000 in September 2022, after one worker was caught between rollers at the company's plant at 5085 North Fraser Way and sustained "serious injury." 20.WorkSafe documents indicate the company had been warned before about inadequate safeguarding and lockout procedures for the mask-making machinery. 19.2022年9⽉，Vitacore公司被罚款1.3万多 加元，原因是该公司位于北弗雷泽路5085号 的⼯⼚有⼀名⼯⼈被卷⼊滚筒之间，导致“严 重受伤”。 20.WorkSafe⽂件显示，该公司之前曾因⼝罩 制造机器的保护和锁定程序不⾜⽽受到警告。 21.Within one six-month period in 2021, at least six workers had been caught in machinery and injured at the company’s factory at 8518 Glenlyon Parkway, according to WorkSafe reports. 2 2 . By January 2023, when the NOW requested an update on the situation, WorkSafe said Vitacore had complied with all the orders it had made to address the safety problems. 21.根据WorkSafe的报告，在2021年的6个⽉ 内，该公司位于Glenlyon Parkway 8518号的 ⼯⼚⾄少有6名⼯⼈被机器夹伤。 22.2023年1⽉，当NOW要求了解最新情况 时，WorkSafe表示，Vitacore已经遵守了它为 解决安全问题⽽下达的所有命令。 语法和⻓句分析 Paragraph 1: "Two 'linked' companies, including one launched in Burnaby during the COVID pandemic to produce N95 medical masks, have been ordered to pay a $2,000 employment standards fine and $51,941.82 in unpaid wages and vacation pay to a former employee." 解析：这是⼀个复合句，主句是“Two 'linked' companies have been ordered to pay a $2,000 employment standards f ine and $51,941.82 in unpaid wages and vacation pay to a former employee”，其中，主语是“Two 'linked' companies”， 谓语是“have been ordered”，宾语是后⾯的整个⾦额和⽤途 的说明。从句“including one launched in Burnaby during the COVID pandemic to produce N95 medical masks”是⼀个⾮ 限制性定语从句，修饰前⾯的“Two 'linked' companies”，说 明这些公司的⼀个是在COVID⼤流⾏期间在Burnaby启动 的，⽬的是⽣产N95医疗⼝罩。 Paragraph 5: "The director of employment standards found in her favour, ruling the companies were 'associated employers' and were 'jointly and severally liable' to pay Kanno $51,941.82 in unpaid overtime and vacation pay." 解析：这是⼀个复合句。主句是“The director of employment standards found in her favour”，其中，“The director of employment standards”作为主语，“found”作为谓语。宾语从 句是“ruling the companies were 'associated employers' and were 'jointly and severally liable' to pay Kanno $51,941.82 in unpaid overtime and vacation pay”，其中，“ruling”引导的是 分词短语作为宾语从句，说明了公司的法律责任状态和需要 ⽀付给Kanno的⾦额。 Paragraph 10: "Vitacore, which originally had two plants in the South Slope area but has since moved operations to Port Coquitlam, makes medical masks, while Strata Engineering is a consulting engineering firm specializing in building science, building envelope, structural, mechanical and geotechnical engineering." 解析：这是⼀个复合句，包含了⼀个主句和两个并列的从 句。主句是“Vitacore makes medical masks, while Strata Engineering is a consulting engineering firm”，其中 “Vitacore”和“Strata Engineering”作为主语，“makes”和“is”作 为谓语。“which originally had two plants in the South Slope area but has since moved operations to Port Coquitlam”是⼀ 个⾮限制性定语从句，修饰“Vitacore”，说明Vitacore的位置 变迁。另⼀个从句“specializing in building science, building envelope, structural, mechanical and geotechnical engineering”是现在分词短语，作为后置定语修饰“consulting engineering firm”，说明这家⼯程咨询公司的专⻓领域。 Paragraph 12: "The two entities shared staff and resources and regularly 'charged back' wages; expenses were shared between the two entities," Stevenson said in his ruling.
