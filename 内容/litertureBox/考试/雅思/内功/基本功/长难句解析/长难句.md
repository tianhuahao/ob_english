26. Just as a doctor calls on the full power of autocratic suggestion by insisting that 
the patient take precisely this white capsule precisely three times a day before meals, 
Lozanov is categoric in insisting that the suggestopedic session be conducted 
exactly in the manner designated, by trained and accredited suggestopedic 
teachers. ( C7T1P3)
参考译文：正如医生充分利用权威暗示的力量，要求病人必须每天三次餐前服用某种白色胶
囊一样，Lozanov 也坚决要求暗示教学法一定要按照事先指定好的方式进行，并且要由培
训过的合格教师来执行。分析：这是一个类比结构，just as 引导比较状语从句，主语是 a 
doctor，谓语是 call on, the full power or autocratic suggestion 是宾语，后面的 insist
接的是宾语从句 that the patient take precisely this white capsule precisely three 
times a day before meals。宾语从句中的主语是 patient，谓语是 take，宾语是 this white 
capsule, three times a day before meals 在句中作状语。主句的主语是 Lozanov, is 
categoric 是表语，insist 后面再次接了宾语从句，在这里 suggestopedic session be 
conducted 是省略了 should 的虚拟语气。原句应该是 that the suggestopedic session 
should be conducted。
语言点：
(1)just as 的用法
just as 表示类比，意为“正如”。
Just human cultures have changed inevitably with the passing of time, so has the 
environment.
正如人类文明会随着时间的推移而不可避免地改变一样，环境也在变化着
常用结构：just as…so…意为“就像……一样，……也”
Just as you sow. so will you reap. 种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆。
Just as you hate math, so I dislike chemistry. 就像你不喜欢数学一样，我不喜欢化学。
(2)宾语从句中的虚拟语气

ask/advise/beg/command /demand / decide / deserve / desire / determine / insist 
/ move (动议：提议)/ order / prefer / propose /require / recommend / request / 
suggest / urge I suggest we finish this first. 我建议我们先把这份工作做完。
27. Another strange feature about Japanese pagoda is that, because the building 
tapers, with each successive floor plan being smaller than the one below, none of 
the vertical pillars that carry the weight of the building is connected to its 
corresponding pillar above. ( C7T2P1)
参考译文：日本宝塔另外一个奇怪特征就是没有一根承重立柱能和上层相应的立柱连在一
起，这是因为日本宝塔每一层的楼层面都比下一层的要小，宝塔于是从下往上逐渐变细。
语言点分析：本句的主干成分是一个表语从句，主语是 another strange feature about Japanese 
pagoda, is 是系动词，that 引导表语从句，because 引导表语从句中的原因状语，表语从
句的主语是 none of the vertical pillars，其后的 that 引导定语从句，表语从句的谓语是
is connected to. 宾语是 its corresponding pillar above。with each successive floor 
plan being smaller than the one below 是一个由 with 引导的独立主格结构，作为 the 
building tapers 这个句子的原因状语存在。
28. It would have been to criticize the MIRTP for using in the early phases a "top�down" approach, in which decisions were made by experts and officials before

the level of the governmental authorities of the district. ( C7T2P3)
参考译文：由于项目初期采用了上级命令下级执行的办法，即没有经过当地社区同意，专家
和政府官员们就作出了决定，马科特乡村一体化交通项日遭到了很多批评，但是从政府层次
开始贯彻实施该项目又是很有必要的。
语言点：
It 实际上是形式主语，这句话真正的主语是不定式 to criticize the MIRTP for using in the 
early phases a “top-down” approach，在这个主语后面，in which 引导定语从句，解
释什么是 a top-down approach，定语从句的主语是 decisions，谓语是被动语态 were 
made, before being handed down to communities 等同于 before decisions were 
handed down to communitie
29. Among these, the world of the ant has come in for considerable scrutiny lately, 
and the idea that ants demonstrate sparks of cognition has certainly not been 
rejected by those involved in these investigations. ( C7T3P1)
参考译文：其中蚂蚁世界就在最近成了主要的观察对象。蚂蚁显示出一定认知力的观点也
得到了研究人员的肯定。
注意：两个代词these所指代的信息需要通过上下文来判断，一般原则为“遇指代，向前
看一句”。本句中所指的分别是“昆虫界”和“调查研究”。
语言点：
(1)句型分析
本句后一个分句中，由the idea引导的主语从句造成句子头重脚轻，给考生理解句意带来
了困难，需要首先辨识出来。该分句的主干为：The idea has certainly not been 
rejected by those. 
(2)词义辨析
considerable adj. fairly large, especially large enough to have an effect or be 
important

31. Whereas prehistoric man had no exposure to urban lifestyle—the forcing 
house of intelligence—the evidence suggests that ants have lived in urban 
settings for close on a hundred million years, developing and maintaining 
underground cities of specialised chambers and tunnels. ( C7T3P1)
参考译文：史前人类没有机会接触城市化的生活方式——这一孕育智能的温床。而证据表
明，蚂蚁已经在城市环境中生存了将近一亿年了，建造并维持着由特殊的洞穴和隧道构成
的地下城市。
语言点：
(1) exposure to: the chance to experience new ideas, ways of life etc. 
The visit to Germany gave them exposure to the language. 他们的德国之旅使他们
接触到了这种语言。
(2) setting adj. the place where something is or where something happens, and

32. Thus, by comparing the Gm allotypes of two different populations(eg. two 
Indian tribes), one can establish their genetic 'distance', which itself can be calibrated to give an indication of the length of time since these populations last 
interbred. ( C7T3P2)
参考译文：所以，通过对比两类不同人群的 Gm 同种异型(比如两个印第安人部落)人们可以
建立各自的“遗传距”，距离本身可以调整，从而可以给出一些信息，提示此族群自从最后

notion of a great many waves of migration to account for the more than 1,000 
languages spoken at one time by American Indians. ( C7T3P2)
参考译文：格林伯格是同时代语言学家中的少数派，而大多数语言学家都赞成这样一种观点：
一波又一波的移民浪潮是解释那一时期北美印第安人讲 1000 多种语言的唯一依据。
语言点：
(1) he in the/a minority: to form less than half of a group 
Boys are very much in the minority at the dance class. 
(2) account for 
a. to form a particular amount or part of something Afro-Americans account for 12%

33. Although forest rims do not affect all of Europe to the same extent, the 
amount of damage caused the experts to propose as the third resolution that the 
Strasbourg conference consider the establishment of a European databank on the 
subject. ( C7T3P3)
参考译文：虽然森林大火对欧洲各国的影响程度不同，但是其破坏力却让专家们提出第三
个决议：斯特拉斯堡会议应该考虑就此主题建立一个欧洲数据库。
语言点：

参考译文：渔民们知道一年中政府允许捕捞的大概时间段。但是在某些特定的日子，某个
地区的一个或多个领域的生物学家有权要求停止捕鱼活动。( C8T1P1)
语言点：
(1) approximate: close to the exact number, amount etc. , but could be a little bit

36. They based their calendars on three natural cycles: the solar day, marked by 
the successive periods of light and darkness as the earth rotates on its axis; the lunar month, following the phases of the moon as it orbits the earth; and the solar 
year, defined by the changing seasons that accompany our planet's revolution 
around the sun. ( C8T1P1)
参考译文：日历的编排基于三个自然周期：以由地球绕地轴自转形成的连续的光明与黑暗
为标记的太阳日；以由月球环绕地球公转形成的月相来衡量的太阴月；以及根据地球绕太
阳公转形成的四季来定义的回归年。
语言点：
(1)句型分析：
此句较长，理解时要注意抓住主干They based their calendars on three natural 
cycles：the solar day, the lunar month, and the solar year，即“日历的编排基于三个
自然周期：太阳日、太阴月和回归年”。其余部分都是对这三个术语的解释说明，理解时
要避免受到干扰。
(2)base...on…以……为基础
Their relationship was based on mutual respect. 他们的关系建立在相互尊重的基础
上。
37. The revolutionary aspect of this new timekeeper was neither the descending 
weight that provided its motive force nor the gear wheels (which had been around 
for at least 1,300 years ) that transferred the power; it was the part called the 
escapement. ( C8T1P1)
参考译文：这种新型计时器所具有的革命意义既不在于依靠向下的重力提供起动力，也不
在于依靠齿轮(至少有1300年的使用历史)传递动力，而在于它使用了一个叫做擒纵机构棘轮装置的部件。
语言点：
(1)句型分析：
认清句子核心结构是理解的关键。由于用neither...nor...这个否定结构连接，分号前的
descending weight和the gear wheels都不是真正的revolutionary aspect。该句的重点
是分号后面的the part called escapement，理解时要分辨清楚。
(2)neither...nor...既不……也不……
Neither riches nor honours can corrupt him; neither poverty nor humbleness can make him swerve from principle; and neither threats nor forces can subdue him.
富贵不能淫，贫贱不能移，威武不能屈。

would leave both sides of the glass marked, and these would then need to be 
ground and polished. ( C8T2P1)参考译文：该工艺可以连续不断地制造几乎各种厚度的
玻璃，但是滚轴会在玻璃板的两面都留下痕迹，这就需要对玻璃进行打磨、抛光。
语言点：
(1)句型分析：
该句逻辑关系较复杂，共有三个部分先转折、后并列。最后一个并列部分中出现指代关系
词these，指代对象并不是the rollers而是glass上的marks。
(2)leave sth+adj.这个结构表示让某物保持某种形态、位置、状况等。如：
You've left your lights on. 你走的时候没关灯。
She must have left the phone off the hook. 她肯定是没挂好电话。

complex and still little understood interactions between the atmosphere and the 
ocean. ( C8T2P2)
参考译文：然而，小冰期远非一个深度冰冻期，它实际上是由大气与海洋之间复杂难解的
相互作用引起的、持续期普遍短于25年的一系列不规则气候剧变的集合。
语言点：
(1)句型分析：
该句结构较复杂。however为插入成分，表示整句话为前一句的转折，该句主干即为
however 之前的部分。rather结构作为far from结构的并列部分，起到说明作用。在此并
列结构中插入一个现在分词短语(few lasting...)，用两个逗号隔开，用于修饰rapid 
climatic shifts。
(2)far from sth这个结构表达的意思是“something very different is true or 
happens”；例如：Conditions are still far from ideal. 条件远远算不上理想。
39. If a laser could generate a line of ionisation in the air 'all the way up to a storm 
could, this conducting path could be used to guide lightning to Earth, before the

long as, on condition that等。此处为if引导的条件状语从句.
40. Perhaps for us today, two of the most significant aspects of most of these 
studies of genius are the frequency with which early encouragement and teaching 
by parents and tutors had beneficial effects on the intellectual, artistic or musical
development of the children but caused great difficulties of adjustment later in 
their lives, and the frequency with which abilities went unrecognised by teachers 
and schools. ( C8T2P2)
参考译文：或许现在对于我们来说，大部分对天才的研究中包含以下两个最重要的方面：
其一，早期教育中父母和教师对孩子进行的频繁的鼓励和教导对孩子在智力、艺术或音乐
方面的发展是有益的，但这也给孩子以后对生活的适应方面带来了巨大的困难；其二，老
师和学校常常认识不到孩子所具备的才能。
语言点：which引导的定语从句

pressure of English globalization.
人们不知道在英语全球化的压力下少数民族语言会怎样。(宾语从句)
42. Animals which save energy by hibernation or lethargy (e.g. bats or 
hedgehogs ) live much longer than those which are always active. The metabolic 
rate of mice can be reduced by a very low consumption of food (hunger diet). 
They then may live twice as long as their well-fed comrades. ( C8T2P3)
参考译文：有些能通过冬眠或嗜睡来保存能量的动物(例如蝙蝠或刺猬)通常比那些总是很
活跃的动物活得更长久。老鼠的代谢速率可以通过减少食物消耗量(饥饿饮食法)来降低，
他们的寿命可能比那些平日吃饱喝足的同类寿命长一倍。
语言点：比较状语从句
常用引导词：as…as…(同级比较)，…than&…(不同程度的比较)
例句：Our future cities and habitats should be as advanced and comfortable as 
scientific and social advances allow them.
我们未来的城市和栖息地应该在科学和社会进步容许的情况下尽可能先进而舒适。

( C8T4P2)
参考译文：到 20 世纪 60 年代中期，情况变得越发令人不安，又出现了四种新害虫，使得
喷洒农药的费用占到了棉花生产费用的 50％。
语言点：句中的 with the outbreak of four more new pests 作原因状语。

( C8T4P2)
参考译文：滥用农药所带来的危害日益加剧。面对这种情况，一种更加行之有效而健全的
生态策略，即生物防虫法，就越来越受欢迎。这种策略主要是有选择性地使用害虫的天
敌。尽管迄今为止，这一新领域潜力有限，但是受欢迎程度还是与日俱增。

(1)face的用法：
1)face可以作及物动词，表示“面朝，正对；正视”的意思，如：
The building faces the square. 房子正对着广场。

life form that is pretty well like us, since if it differs radically from us we may well

communicate with it.
( C9T1P1)
参考译文：第二，我们保守地假定我们正在搜寻的生命形式和人类非常相似，如果形式完
全不同，那么我们可能不会把它看作是一种生命形式，更不用说能否与它进行交流了。

47. However, when we look at the 100 billion stars in our galaxy (the Milky Way)，
and 100 billion galaxies in the observable Universe, it seems inconceivable that at 
least one of these planets does not have a life form on it; in fact, the best 
educated guess we can make, using the little that we do know about the 
conditions for carbon-based life, leads us to estimate that perhaps one in 100，
000 stars might have a life-bearing planet orbiting it. ( C9T1P2)
参考译文：然而，当我们观测银河系中的1，000亿颗恒星和可见宇宙中的1，000亿个星
系的时候，很难相信这些星球中没有一个有生命存在。事实上，凭借我们仅有的一点对碳
基生命的了解，我们所能做出的最有根据的推测是，或许每十万个恒星中的一个会有孕育

词that的定语从句，修饰guess, using the little that we do know about the 
conditions for carbon-based life是现在分词结构作方式状语，修饰guess；在这个句子
结构中，that we do know about the conditions for carbon-based life是定语从句，
修饰前面的little, little在这里相当于little information, do则起强调作用。主句的谓语动
词是leads us to estimate，后面的that引导宾语从句，宾语从句的主语是one in 100，
000 stars，谓语动词是might have，宾语是a life-bearing planet, orbiting it是现在分
词结构作定语，修饰a life-bearing planet，而这里的it则呼应one in 100，000 stars。
48. It's not important then, if there's a delay for a few years, or decades, while the 
human race debates the question of whether to reply, and perhaps carefully drafts 
a replay. ( C9T1P3)
参考译文：就这一点而言，当人类在争论是否要做出回应时，或者在精心起草回应内容的
时候，再耽误个几年甚至几十年也没关系。
语言点：
(1)It是形式主语，真正的主语是if面的整个句子，while在这里引导时间状语从句，
debates和drafts并列。
(2)While可以引导让步状语从句、时间状语从句，也与分词搭配构成非限定小句或无动词
小句。
注意：时间状语从句在一定语境下，可以表示条件、原因或理由。例如：
He became very lonely. He's always like that when he's away from home.
他感到很孤寂；当他离家在外时，他总有那种感觉。
这里的when he's away from home既可以被理解为他孤寂的原因，也可以理解为动作发
生的时间。
49. Whales (including the small whales we call dolphins) and dugongs, with their 
dose cousins the manatees, ceased to be land creatures altogether and reverted 
to the full marine habits of their remote ancestors. They don't even come ashore 
to breed. They do, however, still breathe air, having never developed anything 
equivalent to the gills of their earlier marine incarnation. ( C9T1P3)
参考译文：鲸鱼(包括我们称作海豚的小鲸鱼)和儒艮，与它们的同类动物海牛一样不再是
陆地动物，而完全恢复了与老祖先一样的海洋生活习惯，它们甚至都不上岸繁殖。它们虽
然仍呼吸空气，却没有进化出类似于鳃这样的早期海洋生物的器官。
语言点：
(1)句型分析：最后一句中having never developed anything equivalent to the gills of 
their earlier marine incarnation是对现在分词完成时态的使用。例如：
Having survived there for centuries, they believe their wealth of traditional 
knowledge is vital to the task. And Western scientists are starting to draw on this 
wisdom, increasingly referred to as 'Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit'，or IQ.因纽特人在当地
生活了几百年，他们相信传统知识的财富对于这项任务的完成至关重要。西方的科学家们
也开始逐渐吸收借鉴传统知识。(Cambridge IELTS 6，Test 1，Reading Passage 3)
(2)cease to do sth. 停止做某事，多指长时间甚至永远停止做某事，例如：
The dying man soon ceased to breathe. 那垂死的人很快停止了呼吸
cease doing sth. 停止某事，多指短时间停止做某事，以后还会接着做，例如：
cease talking停止谈话
(3)revert to sth. 回复原状；恢复原来的做法，例如：
He felt as though he was reverting to his adolescence. 他感觉自己好像回到了青春
期。
在生物学上，revert专指“回复突变；返祖遗传”。例如：
This creature has reverted permanently to the aquatic life of its ancestors.
这种生物经回复突变已像祖先那样永久生活在水里了。
50. Hearing impairment or other auditory function deficit in young children can 
have a major impact on their development of speech and communication, 
resulting in a detrimental effect on their ability to learn at school. ( C9T2P1)
参考译文：儿童的听觉障碍或其他听觉功能的缺陷会对他们的言语与交流能力的发展产生
重大的影响，导致他们在学校的学习能力也受到不利影响。
语言点：
句型分析：
Hearing impairment or other auditory function deficit in young children是主语，
have a major impact 0n是谓语，their development of speech and communication
是宾语，resulting in a detrimental effect on their ability to learn at school是由现在
分词resulting引导的结果状语从句。这种用法在以往的剑桥真题中颇为常见，考生应该掌
握，并且可以尝试将这种句型用在作文中。
