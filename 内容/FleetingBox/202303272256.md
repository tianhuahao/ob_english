lieutenant steward groan scissors diligent porch mineral tumble


Once upon a time, there was a lieutenant named John who served in the navy. He was a diligent worker and always made sure to complete his tasks on time. One day, he was assigned to be the steward for the captain's quarters. As he was cleaning the room, he heard a groan coming from the captain's bed. He rushed over to see what was wrong and found that the captain had accidentally cut himself with a pair of scissors while trying to trim his beard. John quickly tended to the captain's wound and made sure he was comfortable.

Later that day, John was sitting on the porch of the ship, enjoying the fresh sea breeze. He noticed a shiny mineral on the ground and picked it up to examine it. Suddenly, the ship hit a rough patch of waves and John tumbled to the ground, dropping the mineral. He searched for it but couldn't find it anywhere.
